# Smart Classroom 

Our "Smart Classroom" project was carried out in January 2020 as part of a two-day hackathon at the Herman Hollerith Center in BÃ¶blingen. Here you can find all the important information about the hackathon!

The idea is to execute a voice command via an Amazon Echo Show (e.g. "Can we start the lecture?"). Thereby the number of students is counted via a camera and compared with the number of participants entered in the online course (RELAX). This number or the different number is then shown on the display of the Echo Show.
